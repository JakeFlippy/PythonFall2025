#Similar to homework 4, write a program that takes a series of commands that allow the user to manipulate text in various ways. This time, you will be using a dictionary to keep track of words that should be replaced with other words. The commands should be as follows:

#add: Adds a new substitution to the dictionary by asking for a word to be replaced and a word to replace it with.
#describe: Prints out all active substitutions in the dictionary.
#run: Ask the user for a sentence. Use your dictionary to make all of the necessary substitutions, then print out the resulting sentence.
#exit: Exit the program.
